# Case-Study-Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-in-Power-BI
🚀 Healthcare Analysis & Benchmarking with Power BI 📊

I recently completed a healthcare analytics case study, where I analyzed New York state-wide hospital discharge data to uncover efficiency opportunities in hospital management. Using Power BI, I explored key factors affecting hospital Length of Stay (LOS) and related costs.

🔍 Key Steps & Insights:

✅ Data Cleaning & Setup: Prepared and structured a dataset of 151 hospitals and 26,000+ discharges related to elective hip replacement surgeries.

✅ Hospital Performance Analysis:
📉 Found that the average LOS was 2.65 days, but it varied significantly between hospitals.
💰 Calculated average cost per discharge ($21K) and identified key cost drivers like severity of illness, hospital size, and patient age.

✅ Benchmarking & Outlier Detection:
🏥 Identified hospitals with the highest LOS and cost, helping to pinpoint inefficiencies.
🔎 Conducted root cause analysis to determine key factors affecting hospital efficiency.

✅ Interactive Power BI Dashboard:
📊 Built a dynamic, visually engaging dashboard to present findings concisely.
🎯 Highlighted high-cost hospitals, LOS trends, and impact of patient disposition on efficiency.

💡 Impact:
📉 Shorter LOS = Lower costs + Increased hospital capacity.
📊 The dashboard provides actionable insights for hospital management to improve efficiency without compromising patient care.
